articleSectionTitle: Our Partnership
articleSectionText: Currently, we are partnered with over hundreds of businesses in the Ottawa area, keeping the partnership local and close to home. These businesses are located throughout Ottawa, with a majority located in the centre core of the city. In Ottawaâ€™s downtown/ByWard Market area, some of our partners include restaurants such as, <i class='italics'>Sidedoor, Eighteen, Milestones, Vittoria Trattoria, and Mill Street Brewery</i>. We also share partnerships with several conference centres, condominiums, and private residences.
articleSectionHeading: The Growler Exchange

articleSectionFollowingSubText: This program encourages the community to return their growler bottles from any local craft brewery to designated locations throughout Ottawa. Once the growler is returned to one of the designated locations, $1 of the return fee goes to BottleWorks.
