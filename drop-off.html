articleSectionTitle: The Growler Exchange
articleSectionText: As the local craft breweries scene grows in the Ottawa area, so do the number of empties. In 2016, local company Brew Donkey donated a business known as the GrowlerExchange, now operated by BottleWorks.
articleSectionSubText: This program encourages the community to return their growler bottles from any local craft brewery to designated locations throughout Ottawa. Once the growler is returned to one of the designated locations, $1 of the return fee goes to BottleWorks. Our team then collects and organizes bottles to return them to their respective craft brewery.
articleSectionSubTextTwo: Beyond the Pale Brewing Company, Bicycle Brewery, and Dominion City Brewing CO. were a few of the amazing partners involved.
